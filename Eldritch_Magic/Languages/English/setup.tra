     @0 = ~ABYSSAL WARRIOR: Those cutters hardy enough to not only survive but thrive in the deadly realms of the Abyss among the pain-inflicting, death-dealing tanar'ri are a tough breed indeed. The Abyss shows no kindness to wizards, but a blood who's good with a sword or axe is useful to the plane's lords and worthy of some respect. That which remains useful in that horrible place stays alive. Abyssal warriors are the mortal fighters who serve in the Blood War, guard tanar'ri palaces, and work as mercenaries in those Abyssal towns where planars can survive.

Advantages:
– Receives a +1 bonus to all Saving Throws.
– Proficient in Blind-fighting.
– 1st level:  Receives a weapon and suit of armor from the Abyss.*
– 10th level: Gains +1 Strength.
– 13th level: Immune to Demon Fear.
– 15th level: May cast Cacofiend once per day.
– 20th level: May cast Summon Fiend once per day.

Disadvantages:
– -1 Charisma.
– -1 Penalty to THAC0 in bright sunlight.
– Alignment restricted to chaotic neutral and chaotic evil.
– Race restricted to tiefling.**


*  Stand still for a moment, then hover over the quick spell options using TAB to select your weapon choice.
** Character will be converted to tiefling upon creation.
   Tieflings have the following traits:
   – 50% cold and magic cold, 25% fire and magic fire, and 15% physical resistance.
   – Infravision.
   – +1 INT and CHA, -1 STR and WIS.~
     @1 = ~BLADESINGER: Of the roving elves, there are few as deadly as the Bladesinger. They are masters of their weapons and have spent their lives in the study of their chosen weapons. They have also learned to cast spells while engaged in combat, and thus they double their might. While some characters may stay at home to defend the elven way, Bladesingers go out and actively promote it. They do this by seeking out their race's foes and eliminating them, either through words or actions. Acting as both diplomats and one-elf armies, they insure the safety of the elf race.

CLASS FEATURES:

– May achieve Grand Mastery (five slots) with any one-handed melee weapon, typically bladed.
– May achieve Grand Mastery (five slots) in Single-Weapon Style.
– May not Specialize in ranged weapons.
– May focus on a single weapon only.
– May not wear armor heavier than chain mail or studded leather. (Spells cannot be cast while wearing armor other than elven chain mail.)
– May not dual-wield, use shields, or use two-handed weapons while bladesinging.
– Level advancement and High Level Abilities (HLAs) of a multi-class fighter/mage.
– May cast arcane spells one-handed with a +2 casting time penalty.
– Must attempt to advance the cause of elvendom somehow at all times, and lend aid to any elf in need.
– Race restricted to elf.
– Alignment restricted to good.
– Hit Die: d7

– Proficient in Blind-fighting
– 14th level: First HLA gained. (3 Million XP.)
– 15th level: Gain recognition from Bladesinger's Guild.
– 22nd level: (8 Million XP.)
– 25th level: Divine Intervention.
– 30th level: Seldarine's Chosen.

Advantages:
1. The Bladesinger chooses one weapon and practices with it extensively, to the exclusion of most other weapons. If practice makes perfect, the Bladesingers are very well practiced in their weapon of choice-for they are virtually perfect. The poised steps of the bladesong (the act of attack by a Bladesinger) not only reveals the Bladesinger to be a creature of beauty even during battle, but the steps also carry him into advantageous positions for either offense or defense. He can instinctively grasp the flow of the battle around him, and his feet will carry him through the intricate maneuvers necessary to optimize his attack. Such is the intensive training of the Bladesinger that he gains an automatic +1 to attack rolls as well as a +1 for damage. This is in addition to the normal elven +1 for use of the long or short sword (if applicable). Despite any additional, further training, this is as high as the bonus can be.

2. Bladesingers receive a special bonus when they wish to try an unusual maneuver with their blade. This bonus is equal to +1 for every four levels the Bladesinger has attained. The bonus only serves to cancel the penalties normally applied for such a maneuver. All other penalties and bonuses still apply.

3. Bladesingers have been taught from an early age to grasp the flow of magic around them and to turn it to their advantage. They can cast spells even while in the front lines. Although they cannot actually attack while casting their spells, they may defend themselves against incoming melee attacks.
Their defense is equal to their level divided by 2, plus 1. All fractions are rounded down. Thus, a 6th-level Bladesinger gains a +4 to AC (6thlevel/2=3+1=+4 AC). The same goes for 7th-level Bladesingers (7/2=3.5-.5=3+1=+4 AC). This does not apply to rear or missile attacks, for it is nearly impossible to defend against those while casting a spell. Bladesingers have practiced the somatic portion of their spells well enough that they may cast their spells one-handed, suffering only a slight penalty. It adds +2 to their casting times, making it easier to disrupt their spells. Like any other spellcaster, if they are hit they lose the concentration necessary for maintaining their spells; they lose the spell. Their spells are, therefore, usually of an offensive nature with very short casting times.

4. The training is hard enough that only a 3rd-level Bladesinger can begin to teach even the rudiments of the bladesong. If another elf wishes to learn the bladesong, he must seek one of the masters of the blade. Bladesingers charge a high price for sharing their skills.

BLADESINGING:
Although the cost is rather steep to learn bladesinging, its practitioners swear by it. Its wide versatility often astounds those who are not familiar with its intricacies. The things even an amateur bladesinger can do with one blade echo tricks that accomplished warriors can do with two, or with a weapon and shield. Those elves willing to devote two slots to learning the rudiments of bladesinging gain the use of the following benefits:
1. They may gain a +1 bonus to their AC or, if they wish to spend an extra slot, may boost this bonus to +2 to their AC. That is the highest bonus those who choose blade-singing as an additional skill can attain. Or
2. They may gain a +1 to hit or, if they wish to spend an extra slot, may boost this to a +2 to attack. As with the AC bonus, +2 is the best they can hope for. Or
3. They may attack and parry in that same round, without wasting any additional attacks. Note that these three benefits are not cumulative; that is, practitioners cannot use all three at once. However, they do have the option of varying between these three options during the course of a combat.

Disadvantages:
The most obvious disadvantage to acquiring the bladesinging weapon style is that a character cannot carry a shield and practice the style at the same time. This technique requires far too much concentration on movement and flow, and the shield gets in the way of the grace and balance necessary to successfully use the style. A more esoteric disadvantage is that this style is most often used by loners-solitary individuals who have no desire to be part of a group. Rarely, this technique may be practiced by someone whose companions will part company with the PC for a decade. Since bladesinging is a very demanding style, the training is intense, difficult, and, above all, long. Therefore, a PC would be well advised to study this style in his or her early years before joining up with a group of adventurers-or else develop some long-lived and understanding friends.

Special Hindrances: To offset their abilities, Bladesingers suffer some severe penalties. Not only must they attempt to advance the cause of elvendom somehow at all times, they must also lend aid to any elf in need. Unless the elf is proven to be an enemy of the elven way of life, the Bladesinger must sacrifice life and limb to save that elf's life. Of course, the Bladesinger is free to determine whether there is, in fact, an elf in danger.
Bladesingers are so devoted to their chosen weapon that they can never learn another one. Unlike other elves, they do not gain a +1 to attack rolls with a bow. With all other weapons, they suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls, even if they have taken it as a proficiency. If they have not devoted the slot to learn the weapon, the Bladesinger suffers the ordinary nonproficiency in addition to the -1 penalty.~
     @2 = ~COLLECTOR: Occasionally, humans will come into possession of items that either aren't theirs or are too dangerous for these short-lived beings to have. The Collector is there to make sure these things return to elf hands. The Collector's role in life is to retrieve things from dangerous places. Whether this item is a stolen suit of elven plate armor or an ancient, unearthed artifact, the Collector will get it back. When humans seem in danger of destroying things of beauty or of historical power, the Collector makes sure those objects are spirited away to safety. The Collector is not only a thief, but an archaeologist as well; <PRO_HESHE> uses all <PRO_HISHER> classes' skills to retrieve the items from wherever they lie, even deep beneath the earth, then keeps them from the hands of the elves' enemies.
     
Advantages:
– KIT COMING SOON

Disadvantages:
– Race restricted to elf.
– Class restricted to fighter/mage/thief.~
     @3 = ~ELDRITCH KNIGHT: The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook. Unlike Bladesingers and War Wizards, the Eldritch Knight kit is not uniquely elven, but rather is limited to fighter/mages and any race that may become one. In fact, there are even rumors of Gnomish Eldritch Knights who exclusively use illusionary magic.

Advantages:
– May cast Green-Flame Blade once per day/level.
– May cast Booming Blade once per day/level.

Disadvantages:
– Race restricted to elf & half-elf.
– Class restricted to fighter/mage.~
     @4 = ~ELVEN MINSTEL: Only elves and half-elves can become Minstrels. Of all musicians in the world, none can play as purely as an elf. Minstrels spend their entire lives seeking musical perfection. Of course, the definition of perfection differs from one culture to the next. Elves believe that music should be simple, pure, beautiful, and natural. Furthermore, those who listen should become lost in the music, and their spirits should transcend their bodies to ride upon the sweet flow of glittering notes. Elves are a very magical race, and this is especially true of Minstrels. It is said that Minstrels cast spells by the simple strumming of an instrument.
     
Advantages:
– KIT COMING SOON

Disadvantages:
– Race restricted to elf & half-elf.~
     @5 = ~HERBALIST: Even when these priests have run out of healing spells, they are not useless as healers. The elf Herbalist can soothe fevers and mend wounds with the utmost ability and speed. Herbalists are very knowledgeable about the various herbs found in their domains. They can locate even the hard-to-find ones, although that might take some searching. Their herb lore is unsurpassed, except by druids.

Advantages:
– May cast Goodberry once per day. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 5 levels thereafter.
– May cast Neutralize Poison once per day. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 10 levels thereafter.

Disadvantages:
– Race restricted to elf and half-elf.
– Alignment restricted to good and neutral.~
     @6 = ~HUNTSMAN: Although some call them bounty hunters, the Huntsmen know better. Their chief joy in life is the hunt, and they have trained themselves in the ways of life: fighting and stealth. A Huntsman is at home in both the city and the wilderness. His job is to track down errant wrongdoers and bring them to justice. He can be good, evil, or neutral; he may ethically bring criminals to face the law or hunt them just for money. Whether he is good or not good, his motivation is more the thrill of the hunt than material gain.
     
Advantages:
– KIT COMING SOON

Disadvantages:
– Race restricted to elf.
– Class restricted to fighter/thief.~
     @7 = ~INFILTRATOR: The Infiltrator is the very model of an elf scout. Whether in urban or wilderness situations, the Infiltrator is the master of stealth and disguise. When elves need quick and reliable information with a minimum of fuss, they call on an Infiltrator. The Infiltrators' motto is "If it's a secret, it's not." Sometimes, the Infiltrator will gain information simply for the sheer joy of knowing it. Although this is a typically elven trait, only the Infiltrators go to such an extent to learn a secret.
     
Advantages:
– KIT COMING SOON

Disadvantages:
– Race restricted to elf.
– Class restricted to fighter/mage/thief.~
     @8 = ~PRIEST OF MYSTRA: Mystra is the Mother of All Magic and tender of the Weave. Her followers are often proficient with both arcane and divine spells.

Advantages:
– May cast Mystra's Silver Fire once per day. Gains two uses at level 1 and an additional use every 5 and 10 levels thereafter.

MYSTRA'S SILVER FIRE: This spell explodes for 1d6 fire damage per level of the caster up to 20d6. Save vs. Spell for half.

Disadvantages:
– Class restricted to cleric/mage.
– Alignment restricted to good and neutral.~
     @9 = ~PRIESTESS OF LOLTH: Lolth, or Lloth in the drow tongue, the Demon Queen of Spiders, is the chief goddess of drow elves. Her servants must appease the arachnid deity to avoid death, or punishment in the form of life as a drider. Priestesses of Lolth gain no more abilities from their deity than clerics of the surface elves; in fact, the Demon Queen only blesses drow with the most exceptional power, and only the greatest among those ever attain the rank of High Priestess. It is for this reason that followers of Lolth work exceptionally hard to overcome mortal limits. It is routine for priestesses to emulate spiders in their training at any cost. They must learn on their own how to avoid being caught in spider web, lest they be devoured by their own arachnids. Furthermore, each priestess relentlessly consumes poison in order to build up a natural resistance, either eventually overcoming the frail elven constitution, or dying.

Advantages:
– May cast Spider Spawn once per day. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 5 levels thereafter.
– May cast Shapeshift: Spider once per day. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 10 levels thereafter.
– 3rd level: Immune to Web.
– 9th level: Immune to Poison.

Disadvantages:
– Alignment restricted to chaotic evil.
– Race restricted to drow elf.*
– Gender restricted to female.**


*  Character will be converted to drow upon creation.
   50% base magic resistance +2%/level up to 65%.
** Character will be converted to female upon creation. Choose portrait, voice, and name accordingly.

Ability Score Adjustments: Drow are extraordinarily dexterous and intelligent. They gain a bonus of +2 to Dexterity and a +1 to Intelligence. However, their personalities can be described as grating at best (although not usually to their faces), and they have the typical elf Constitution. Thus, they have a -2 penalty to Charisma and a -1 to their initial Constitution scores.~
     @10 = ~SPELLFILCHER: This mage/thief is adept at breaking into wizard's domiciles to purloin magical goods, particularly spellbooks and rare spell components. Through a strange inner talent, the spellfilcher has an amazing ability. When there is a magical trap to be disarmed or magical treasure to be gotten, the Spellfilcher is the one to do it. Trained from her early years, the Spellfilcher uses an innate magical ability to locate and disarm traps that would victimize another.
     
Advantages:
– KIT COMING SOON

Disadvantages:
– Race restricted to elf.
– Class restricted to mage/thief.~
     @11 = ~UNDEAD HUNTER: This holy avenger has honed his abilities toward the destruction of the undead and other unnatural creatures and is immune to many of their most devastating abilities.

Advantages:
– +3 bonus to hit and damage rolls against undead creatures.
– Immune to hold and level drain.

Disadvantages:
– May not use Lay On Hands ability.~
     @12 = ~WAR WIZARD: Although elves do not desire war, preferring instead to live their lives in peace and idyllic happiness, they recognize that the world is full of races hostile to elves, all of whom would love to see them driven into the dirt. A War Wizard is one who has devoted <PRO_HISHER> life to defending against such attacks. The War Wizard is usually the person in charge of defense for any given elf town. When there is a problem with an enemy, the War Wizard is the one to call. Even if not associated with a town, the War Wizard is an invaluable asset to any group that expects to face trouble. Simple strategic knowledge is <PRO_HISHER> bread and butter, but <PRO_HISHER> expertise does not end there - <PRO_HESHE> can work offensive marvels physically, and <PRO_HISHER> spellcasting skills are excellent. Magic is an integral part of the elven lifestyle. Elves' very lives are inherently magical; the blood of a god flowing through one's veins tends to give that person a much different perspective on the workings of magic. As such, War Wizards become increasingly defensive, in personality and passive protections. These elves excel at repelling enemy spellcasting and even weapons with their layers of contingencies, but War Wizards have no shortage of offensive spells for retaliation.

Advantages:
– +1 Save vs. Spell every 4th level up to +5 at level 20.
– +1 bonus to Armor Class every 5th level up to +4 at level 20.
– 6th level: May cast Enchanted Weapon once per day.
– 12th level: May cast Mordenkainen's Sword once per day.

Disadvantages:
– Slower casting speed by 1.
– May not Specialize in ranged weapons.
– -1 THAC0 Penalty with all Missile Weapons.
– Reduced Lore.
– Increased Fatigue.
– Race restricted to elf.
– Class restricted to fighter/mage.~
     @13 = ~WILDERNESS RUNNER: There are rangers, and then there are rangers. Elves are uniquely connected with the rhythms of the forests, some more deeply than others. Only those who have chosen to become rangers may elect to become more fully part of the forest. They are called Wilderness Runners. Wilderness Runners have cast aside the trappings of even elven society to serve the needs of the wood. Although they still respect and serve their own society, they take no part in its functions. They may serve as scouts or advance guards for elf cities, but they will not willingly enter civilization. If the Wilderness Runner is a high elf, <PRO_HESHE> is far less civilized than <PRO_HISHER> brethren and demonstrates the tendencies of sylvan elves.
     
Advantages:
– +1 Constitution.
– Gains one use of Charm Animal every level.
– Gains 1% Fire and Cold resistance per level up to 20% at level 20.
– Gains 5% Tracking bonus and +1 Movement Speed at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level.

Disadvantages:
– -1 Charisma.
– Race restricted to elf.
– Alignment restricted to chaotic good.
– May not wear armor heavier than studded leather.~
     @14 = ~WINDRIDER: Few mounted cavalry are as glamorous and exciting as the Windriders. The elite of the elf forces, they are greatly envied by common elves and greatly feared by foes. The powerful and majestic mounts they ride into combat make Windriders more dangerous than most infantry, but at the cost of being a larger and more preferentially attacked target. The Windrider is the knight of the air, defending elf lands against aerial attacks. In times of war, they are both shock troops and scouts. While most Windriders mount griffons, hippogriffs, or pegasi, brave elves of the Sword Coast are rather limited in their choices and have been known to ride wyverns instead.
     
Advantages:
– May cast Summon Mount once per day. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 5 levels thereafter.

SUMMON MOUNT: The Windrider calls forth a wyvern mount of appropriate maturity for <PRO_HISHER> level.
This ability may only be used outdoors.

Disadvantages:
– -1 Armor Class.
– Race restricted to elf.
– Alignment restricted to good.
– May not exceed Specialization (two slots) in any weapon class.~
     @15 = ~tiefling~
     @16 = ~TIEFLINGS: Of all the plane-touched, none precipitate as much fascination – or as much fear – as tieflings. Whereas aasimar are obviously touched by a celestial spark, and genasi have the potency of the elements running through their veins, tieflings are enshrouded with the mysteries of an unnamed heritage.
Obviously human and "something-else" crossbreeds, the "something else" in the tieflings' case is usually assumed to be lower-planar. That stigma follows all tieflings throughout their lives. Loners by nature, they make their own paths out of necessity; no tiefling culture exists to aid the outcasts, since no two tieflings are alike. As distinctive from humans as they are from each other, tieflings tend to be wary and distrustful due to the reactions they come to expect from others. Tieflings take care of themselves, for they learn early that no one will take care of them.
But rather than withdraw into individual hermitages, tieflings challenge the multiverse with everything in their dependent spirits. Determined to create their own fates, they dare things others might not even dream of and defy anything that stands in their way.

Tieflings may be a common sight in Sigil, but they're a rarity on the Prime Material Plane, especially along the Sword Coast. More often than not, the few tieflings who can suvive Abeir-Toril appear to be elves or half-elves with traits to match. Only those tieflings who revel in their fiendish heritage display the traits listed below.

Tieflings have the following traits:
- 50% resistance against cold-based attacks.
- Infravision.
- +5% Find Traps, +10% Move Silently, +10% Hide in Shadows.
- +1 Intelligence and Charisma, -1 Strength and Wisdom.~
     @17 = ~Tiefling~
     @18 = ~You know little of how you came to be a ward of Gorion's, but over the years you have gleaned something of your mother's tale from his vague allusions and from the words he sometimes uttered in tear-filled sleep. She was a tiefling from the High Forest and a friend of his for many seasons. As you have no memory of her, nor any keepsakes to remind you of her existence, you have come to believe that she died while giving birth to you. Perhaps it was the pain of such a parting that led Gorion to cloister himself within the narrow halls of Candlekeep and raise you as his own. Of your father, you have learned nothing.~
     @19 = ~vampire~
     @20 = ~VAMPIRES: Of all the chaotic evil undead creatures that stalk the world, none is more dreadful than the vampire. Moving silently through the night, vampires prey upon the living without mercy or compassion. Unless deep underground, they must return to the coffins in which they pass the daylight hours, and even in the former case they must occasionally return to such to rest, for their power is renewed by contact with soil from their graves. One aspect that makes the vampire far more fearful than many of its undead kindred is its appearance. Unlike other undead creatures, the vampire can easily pass among normal men without drawing attention to itself for, although its facial features are sharp and feral, they do not seem inhuman. In many cases, a vampire's true nature is revealed only when it attacks. There are ways in which a vampire may be detected by the careful observer, however. Vampires cast no reflection in a glass, cast no shadows, and move in complete silence.~

     @29 = ~Elven Boots of Speed: The Paws of the Lythari
The origin of these boots is disputed, but one thing is clear: if they are of elven origin, they are either extremely ancient, or not from a subrace of elves common to Faerun. Rumors say they are not of the Teu-Tel'Quessir, Moon Elves or Silver Elves in the common tongue, the elves most prevalent in Faerun. Others say the remarkably lupine fur lining the boots is not that of a wolf, but rather a Lythari- elven lycanthropes so far from their elven roots as to be considered a separate race from elves by Faerunian scholars. These mysterious boots not only double the wearer's movement rate, but also provide free action. As with all items made (or aquired) by the Bladesinger's Guild and later given to their elites, so too are these boots warded for good-aligned elves.

This particular suit has protected many elven heroes, and radiates an intense aura of goodness, preventing evil ownership. The link between <CHARNAME> and the Divine allowed this artifact of godly power to materialize in the Pocket Plane during the Time of Troubles; perhaps to advance <PRO_HISHER> righteous cause, or aid in <PRO_HISHER> defeat, should Bhaal's taint manifest itself.

It's obvious why the noble Bladesinger's Guild would keep this item from those with unlawful intent.

There is no single version of the long sword; the design and length vary from culture to culture and may vary within the same culture depending on the era. Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from thirty-five inches to forty-seven inches. In the latter case, the blade is known to take up forty inches of the total length. Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip. Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting.

     @45 = ~Seldarine's Fury: Shame of the Gods
The creation of this artifact is unknown to all but the most legendary elves. Knowledge of the blade's existence is exceedingly rare; wielding it is unheard of. To grasp the beautiful golden hilt is painful to all but good natured elves, and deadly to enemies of the elven race. Those deemed worthy will feel the sword's sentience immediately as images of the Seldarine of Arvandor in a time before history flood the mind. Seared into the wielder's memory are vivid depictions of Corellon Larethian leading the elven pantheon in the creation of their greatest weapon, and deepest regret- for if this sword were to be twisted by evil, it would surely be apocalyptic. With the fear of the Gods coursing through your body, another feeling begins to manifest- protect the elven way at all costs. The wielder can feel the sentient blade bolstering their mind and reflexes, as well as their vitality being drained just from holding it. Clearly this wasn't meant for mortal hands.

She is sometimes considered the personification of three seperate elven goddesses, Aerdrie Faenya, Hanali Celanil, and Sehanine Moonbow, as well as a single goddess who extends beyond these three separate aspects. It is said that this blade, shaped from the beauty of her song, is the physical maifestation of Angharradh's fierce protectiveness and strong resolve, and that similar to the Triune Goddess, reflects traits of each of these deities.

Kazgaroth the Beast is a powerful minion of Bhaal that has long haunted the Moonshae Isles. His origin is lost to the mists of time, but he is at least 5 centuries old. Although Kazgaroth can be slain, he always rises again a few years later to once again terrorize the Moonshaes. It is said that only the legendary sword of Cymrych Hugh can permanently destroy the Beast. Even then, his essence may live on within the heart of Kazgaroth, a black, stonelike artifact of great power. Bhaal's taint within the claw could be used to create an item of wicked power for a Bhaalspawn chaotic enough to do so.

This flawless +5 armor was created for Sarevok to harness his Divine blood, before his death beneath the city of Baldur's Gate.

The blade of Sarevok, brother of <CHARNAME>, used in the battle they fought in faraway Baldur's Gate. <CHARNAME> prevailed, destroying Sarevok's plans and rescuing the Sword Coast from the brink of war. The sword itself defies identification, likely forged specifically for Sarevok to best focus the infernal energy he hoped to control. Much of its power died with him, however, the blade has since been silvered and honed to a vorpal edge, as well as heavily enchanted to allow a restored link to the sliver of Bhaal's essence within Sarevok. Fused with the power of Kazgaroth the Beast by Cespenar, this sword is more chaotic than ever.

Dungeon-delving Lehorgan was lucky indeed to discover this Halruaan blade in the ruins of the ancient sorcerer Kullon's haunt, for it would save his life that very day. The ghost of Kullon himself attacked the intruder, but the flames that followed only singed, absorbed into the glowing Bloodbrand. Concealing himself, Lehorgan watched in amazement as the ancient sorcerer tried to divine his location, and again the sword protected him. Surviving this brush with death, the young man used this second chance and the gold from selling the blade to, as he put it, "get the hell out of adventuring." 
It is not known how Kullon found his way back to his Bloodbrand, but it is noticeably more powerful with the ghost of the ancient sorceror residing within. While a scrying spell cannot divine the location of this sword in space, similar spells reveal that the very nature of its current magical enchantment is a temporal anomaly; this sword should not exist the way it does in this era. All attempts to converse with Kullon's spirit are futile.

     @64 = ~Netherese Spellblade~
     @65 = ~Long before the Sharn trapped the evil Phaerimm beneath the Anauroch Desert, the Netherese archwizard Karsus devised a plan to temporarily become a deity and defeat the Phaerimm himself- subsequently leading to the fall of Netheril known as Karsus's Folly. Some blame the great archwizard Ioulaum for abandoning Netheril and promting Karsus to take such drastic measures. Before his disappearance, and even the start of the war with the Phaerimm, Ioulaum collaborated with Karsus on the creation of this powerful dagger. It's covered in indecipherable Loross written with Draconic script, the Netherese noble tongue and one of the languages of the City of Shade, Thultanthar. It's rumored that the dagger was a gift for Thultanthar's high mage, known only as Lord Shadow. It was Lord Shadow who experimented with the Plane of Shadow, and shifted his entire city over from the Prime Material Plane mere days before Karsus temporarily destroyed the Weave- and it seems like he took this now shade-touched dagger with him for at least 1700 years, before Thultanthar returned to Faerun. This dagger weighs heavily in your hand and is warm to the touch. Merely having it on your person makes you feel uneasy for some reason. The gem mounted in the hilt seems to have an inner light of some sort, though how it can have such illumination and still be so deathly black at its core, you do not know. It is also unknown which enchantments are original to the spellblade and which are from millennia of residing in the Plane of Shadow and being wielded by powerful Shadovar.

The greater deity of elemental fire, Kossuth, created this sword from the core of a neutron star for one of his most powerful underlings. The gift, however, proved too much power for the demigod and ultimately absorbed him, bolstering the sword's flame even more, but also calming its elemental fury.

However, illithid could sense the object for miles, and they weren't fond of its creation. The drow creator, whose name has long since been forgotten, did not live long past his legacy. Dozens of mind flayers and umber hulks ambushed him in his sleep, but he had the advantage against their psionics. He might have survived the encounter too, if the beholders of the region hadn't decided it'd be an excellent time to ambush the illithid. Those who wield the Psionicist's Cowl are immune to the mind flayer's psionic attacks. The bewildering gaze of umber hulks, often found serving the illithid, are similarly rendered harmless. It seems as if the xenophobic creator expected this powerful item to trade hands often, and thus warded it against all non-elf races. Oddly enough, it works for surface elves.

One thing is fairly certain though: James lived an incredible life that puts most bardic tales of bravery and heroism to shame. He sailed on the Wandering Eye with Balduran and battled lycanthropes with a sword of gold that he supposedly stole from a dragon's hoard. Being one of the few survivors to make it back to the mainland, James decided to charter his own ship and sail westward, believing the Father of the Four Winds blessed his explorations. Along the way, he angered Talos with his lack of fear or tribute to the Stormlord, but despite the deity leaving no trace of his vessel, James miraculously made it to uncharted shores. While mapping this new world, he saved the fey Prince of Peace from a black dragon and was subsequently knighted by the Queen of Light. Many historians, however, doubt any of this actually happened- seeing as nothing recorded beyong his youth as a page has been uncovered, and it is even said he never made the rank of squire for reasons unknown. Furthermore, many of the characters involved in the wild tale of Sir James have never been documented, only strengthening the resolve of disbelievers. Possibly all that remains of his adventures is this ring, if it was truly his- all you know for sure is that this band of gold, inscribed with magic runes, possesses incredible power.~

     @141 = ~The delicate yet sturdy craftsmanship of the elven races allows them to design many beautiful yet utilitarian goods. Among these is elven chain mail, which is so finely wrought that it can be worn under normal clothing without revealing its presence. This particular suit is believed to have been created by a long-forgotten apprentice of the legendary elven armorsmith, Asylferund. While the master sought a way to forge chain mail of the highest enchantments, the student focused on smithing armor more practical for warrior rogues and wizards. By studying the magical robes worn by archmages and the dark suits of leather iconic to the Shadowmasters of Amn, Asylferund's apprentice was able to create a suit of armor able to meet the demands of any misson conceivable. Due to the nature of its enchantment, it can only be worn by those of good alignment.

Where he found the stone is a mystery, as well as where it went after Geraq's mysterious disappearance, but holding it in one's hand, one can hear the whispers of Geraq's expertise sounding across the centuries. Of course, the whispers are all spoken in the language of goblins, making them more or less useless to the humanoid races; even so, the stone bestows greater knowledge on any who possess it.

By McComb and Pryor

  An elite group of elven fighter mages, the blade-singers are dedicated to the defense of the elven nation, and many of them journey back to Faerûn to help defend those elves who stayed behind or have yet to join the Retreat. 
  Bladesingers are terrifying weapons experts and spellcasters. On Evermeet they are organized into small warrior lodges, each specializing in a different weapon. They are even more dedicated to the ancient ways and styles of dress than other Silver elves. They often tattoo themselves with old runes and symbols and their armor and weapon are all of great antiquity and beautiful craftsmanship.~

When he was a young man, he set off for the city to hire himself out as a mercenary. After a number of successful endeavors, Kheros became a short-term member of many adventuring companies. Along the way, despite his many victories, Kheros became disgusted and terrified by the sight of blood.

His fear eventually spiraled out of control, consuming him with madness. Priests of Tempus found the huge warrior and took him into safekeeping. The priests believed that they could cure Kheros of his fear. Over several years, Kheros learned the ways of the Tempuran religion, eventually becoming a priest. His final step in overcoming his fear was being submerged in a tub of blood until he almost drowned. All the time he was held down, he never struggled, flinched, or tried to escape. In his later years, he had a suit of armor made to remind him of his past.

The blade seems to draw its strength from Lac Dinneshere itself. As long as the wielder is within a dragon's flight of the lake (a considerable distance by most race's standards), the blade is a fearsome weapon.

What is known is that a small portion of the dead god's essence found its way to the Astral Plane, where it coalesced into one of the smallest islands of slain divinity. This small hunk of rock and odd ore was captured hundreds of years later by an enchanter named Merdros. Merdros's duergar servants created this blade for the wizard's most powerful warrior ally.

This spell creates a green, fire-like, weightless area of magical force extending from the fingers of one of the caster's hands. The crackling, blade-shaped construct's cutting edges inflict slashing damage just as those of a real sword do. The caster wields the green-flame blade as if proficient with it, at <PRO_HISHER> normal THAC0. An opponent that hits the caster with any weapons or spells within a 5-ft. radius suffers 1d8+2 points of fire damage so long as the green-flame blade is wielded.

The green-flame blade initially acts as a +1 magical sword in terms of to-hit and damage bonuses as well as the type of creatures it can hit. To-hit, damage bonuses, and effective enchantment level increase by +1 every 4th level up to a maximum bonus of +6 at level 20. The fire damage also increases in intensity from +1 up to +1d6. This sword can only be used by the caster and remains in <PRO_HISHER> hand for the duration of the spell or until dispelled. Furthermore, spellcasting is disabled while the green-flame blade is in use.

An opponent that hits the caster with any weapons or spells within a 5-ft. radius suffers 1d8+2 points of electricity damage so long as the booming blade is wielded.

The booming blade initially acts as a +1 magical sword in terms of to-hit and damage bonuses as well as the type of creatures it can hit. To-hit, damage bonuses, and effective enchantment level increase by +1 every 4th level up to a maximum bonus of +6 at level 20. The electricity damage also increases in intensity from +1 up to +1d6. This sword can only be used by the caster and remains in <PRO_HISHER> hand for the duration of the spell or until dispelled. Furthermore, spellcasting is disabled while the booming blade is in use.

– Level 1: 1d8+1, +1 electricity damage
– Level 4: 1d8+2, +1d2 electricity damage
– Level 8: 1d8+3, +1d3 electricity damage
– Level 12: 1d8+4, +1d4 electricity damage

Mystra's Silver Fire is an explosive burst of flame, which detonates with a low roar and delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard-priest who cast it—1d6 points of damage for each level of experience of the caster (up to a maximum of 20d6). The wizard-priest points <PRO_HISHER> finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the Mystra's Silver Fire is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation). Creatures failing their Saving Throws each suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful Saving Throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half.~

Use of the Improved Magic Missile spell, an improved variant of one of the most popular 1st-level spells, creates up to eleven missiles of magical energy that dart forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort. Each missile inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage.

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None 

There are a few notable differences between Wraithform and the more powerful Shadovar variant. Most notably, Wraithform is of the Alteration and Illusion schools while Shadovar Wraithform is of the Necromancy school, reflecting the more realistic nature of this form. When this spell is cast, the wizard and all of <PRO_HISHER> gear become insubstantial. The caster is subject only to magical or special attacks, including those by weapons of +1 or better enchantment, or by creatures otherwise able to affect those struck only by magical weapons. The wizard no longer gains the 25% resistance to magic damage associated with Wraithform, but instead gains 100% resistance to cold, magic cold, and acid damage. Shadovar wraiths have a base armor class of 4, THAC0 of 15, and 1 attack per round. They are also immune to charm, sleep, hold, and poison. This spell will allow the caster to deal 1d6 slashing or piercing damage (whichever is better) +1 magical cold and drain 1 level per attack with an effective +4 magic level. While in shadovar wraithform, the caster can cast arcane or divine spells normally.~

With this spell, a wizard is able to assume the form of a powerful werewolf, and at higher levels, the form of a greater werewolf. No wizard is known to have mastered lycanthropy to the extent of druid shapeshifters and thus the transformation is limited to one hour.
Rumors talk of ancient werewolves with more primal power than any mortal should have, but it's unlikely that the form of such an apex predator can be attained without succumbing to a more permanent curse of lycanthropy.

A favorite among the most chaotic and evil of wizards, this transformation will settle most disputes quickly, albeit with no shortage of bloodshed. Supposedly this spell was created by one of the very first Draegloth sorcerors, the unholy union of Drow and tanar'ri. The rumor implies that the Draegloth attained the pinnacle of arcane prowess among the Drow, but continually sought greater power. Legend says he found his way to the Demonweb Pits where Lolth taught him to tap directly into the Abyss to channel his demonic power. No one knows the truth of this spell's origin except the creator, but all stories agree that the original caster of this spell never could return to his half-drow, half-demon form and to this day wanders the Abyss seeking a way to undo his shapechange. Tieflings with less than half demon heritage *should* be okay. Not usable by good characters.

This spell was designed by Mystra herself to utterly dismantle the Weave around a wizard with a barrage of Spellstrike, Pierce Shield, Ruby Ray of Reversal, and Khelben's Warding Whip. The intense arcane energies daze the afflicted target prompting a save vs. Spell at a -2 penalty against Miscast Magic, an 80% chance of arcane and divine spell failure for 1 turn. Not usable by evil characters.

Spellstrike
(Abjuration, Alteration)
When this spell is cast at a target creature, it will dispel all of the magical protections that surround that creature. This includes Minor Spell Turning, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Minor Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Spell Shield, Spell Deflection, and Spell Trap. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.

Pierce Shield
(Abjuration)
When this spell is cast, it launches a massive attack on an enemy wizard's spell defenses. The target's Magic Resistance will be lowered by 30%. Next, Pierce Shield will cancel one spell protection of any level. The list of spells that this includes: Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Spell Turning, Spell Deflection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Turning, Spell Shield, and Spell Trap. Magic Resistance does not affect this spell, nor do any of the spell protections. The resistance remains lowered for 1 round per level of the caster. It cannot be dispelled.

Ruby Ray Of Reversal
(Alteration)
When this spell is cast, it dispels one spell protection of any level affecting the target creature. The spells affected by Ruby Ray Of Reversal are Minor Spell Turning, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Minor Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Spell Shield, Spell Deflection, and Spell Trap. This will always remove the highest-level spell protection affecting the target; if more than one same-level protection is active on the target simultaneously, one of them will be randomly chosen and dispelled. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.

Khelben's Warding Whip
(Abjuration)
When this spell is cast, it will dispels one spell protection of up to 8th level affecting the target creature. Every round thereafter till the duration of the spell expires, another spell protection will be removed from the target. The spells affected by Khelben's Warding Whip are Minor Spell Turning, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Minor Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Spell Deflection, and Spell Shield. This will always remove the highest-level spell protection affecting the target; if more than one same-level protection is active on the target simultaneously, one of them will be randomly chosen and dispelled. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.

This spell conjures a gate to the 600th layer of the Abyss, the Endless Maze, through which you channel the power of Baphomet the Demon Prince of Minotaurs. What emerges from the abyssal rift is a massive meateor singed with flame. The impact spells udder cowtastrophe for the victim of this bovine-boulder; one would be lucky to escape mootilated. Only the most evil wizards would milk the benefits of this brutal spell. Abusers of this spell steer away from the notions of law and good, surely becoming as beasts.

This ability allows the rogue to set a magical trap that casts a weaker version of the high-level Time Stop spell. For 10 seconds, the flow of time slows for all but the rogue. Often, a rogue will use this trap to get behind an opponent for a free attack. ~
     @1049 = ~Evasion~

     @1051 = ~Greater Evasion~
     @1052 = ~Greater Evasion
A more powerful version of Evasion, this ability improves Armor Class by 6 and Saving Throws by 3. In addition, Greater Evasion allows the rogue to move so quickly that <PRO_HISHER> movement rate is increased by 2 (base is 10) and normal missiles have no chance of striking <PRO_HIMHER>. Greater Evasion lasts for 5 rounds.

Requires: Evasion~
     @1053 = ~Use Any Item~
     @1054 = ~Use Any Item
Rogues take pride in their ability to adapt and make clever use of whatever is at hand. This ability is an extension of that basic skill. Once learned, the effect is permanent. The ability allows the rogue to use any item, even items that are typically restricted to one class. This allows the rogue to use everything from wands and scrolls to mighty weapons that none but a warrior could otherwise use.~
     @1055 = ~Assassination~
     @1056 = ~Assassination
Using every clever trick an experienced Thief has learned in countless battles, this ability allows every strike in the next round to act as a backstab, using the Thief's existing backstab modifier to determine damage.~

     @1058 = ~Avoid Death
With extraordinary effort, a high-level rogue can avoid almost certain death. The effect lasts for 5 rounds, and during this time, the rogue's Save vs. Death receives a bonus of 5, Hit Points are increased by 20, and the rogue becomes immune to death magic.~
     @1059 = ~Alchemy~

With cleverness innate to the class, an experienced rogue has seen enough potions in his or her adventuring career to simulate the creation of one. With the Alchemy skill, the rogue can create one of eight types of potions once per day. 

The potions a rogue can create are randomly chosen from the following list: 
1) Potion of Master Thievery 
2) Potion of Perception
3) Potion of Extra Healing
4) Potion of Superior Healing

     @1063 = ~Enhanced Bard Song~

This is a powerful aid to both the Bard and to <PRO_HISHER> allies. The song gives the Bard <PRO_HIMHER>self a 10-point bonus to <PRO_HISHER> Armor Class and a 10% bonus to <PRO_HISHER> Magic Resistance due to the power of the song. The song also gives <PRO_HISHER> allies +4 to hit; +4 to damage; -4 to Armor Class; immunity to fear, stun, and confusion; +5% Magic Resistance; and immunity to normal weapons.

This ability replaces the current Bard Song.~
     @1065 = ~Magic Flute~

The spell-like abilities on the Flute are used in the same way that a wand's powers are used. The Flute lasts for 1 day.~
     @1067 = ~Whirlwind Attack~
     @1068 = ~Whirlwind Attack
This ability allows the warrior to unleash a flurry of super-fast blows. The ability sets one's number of attacks per round to 10, but one's THAC0 and damage suffer a 4 point penalty. The Whirlwind Attack lasts for one round.~
     @1069 = ~Greater Whirlwind Attack~

This ability allows the warrior to temporarily tap a great inner strength and fight off the effects of malevolent magic. For 4 rounds, the warrior's Magic Resistance is set to 50%.

     @1078 = ~Critical Strike
A high-level warrior's intimate knowledge of vital spots on opponents allows <PRO_HIMHER> to, once per day, concentrate all of the attacks in one round to strike a vital area every time. With this ability, every attack roll made in the next round is a natural 20, a critical hit.

With the Smite ability, the warrior gains the ability to strike a mighty blow, knocking an opponent back for a considerable distance and stunning the opponent for 1 round. All attacks made in the first round are critical hits. The ability lasts for 2 rounds.

Large creatures such as a dragons or giants will not be knocked back or stunned.

Requires: Power Attack, Critical Strike~
     @1087 = ~Tracking~
     @1088 = ~Tracking
With an intimate knowledge of <PRO_HISHER> surroundings and the creatures that live within them, a ranger can use the Tracking ability to give <PRO_HIMHER>self a general idea of what creatures are in an area and which direction they are.

     @5000 = ~Wand~
     @5001 = ~Wands are 1 1/4 ft. long and slender. They are made of ivory, bone, or wood and are usually tipped with something—metal, crystal, stone, and so on. They are fragile and tend to break easily. Because of this, they are often kept in cases.

Wands are powered by charges, each use costing one or more charges (depending on the item). When a wand runs out of charges, it is consumed and destroyed.

<CHARNAME> has gained the ability, usable once per day: 

Hand of Murder (Necromancy) 
Range: Caster
Duration: 1 rounds/5 levels
Casting Time: 1
Saving Throw: none 

When this power is called upon by the Bhaalspawn, <PRO_HESHE> immediately does extra damage with each hit to <PRO_HISHER> target with any melee weapon desired (whether it be fist or sword). <PRO_HISHER> dark energies travel through <PRO_HISHER> weapon and assaulting <PRO_HISHER> victim...and absorb that damage as healing for <PRO_HIMHER>self.
The effects vary by level as follows:
10th: 2 rounds, 4 hp extra damage, 4 hp healed
15th: 3 rounds, 6 hp extra damage, 6 hp healed

<CHARNAME> has gained 25% resistance to physical damage (i.e., slashing, piercing, crushing and missile damage).~

@3000 = ~Sword of Chaos +4~
@3001 = ~Sarevok's Sword of Chaos
The blade of Sarevok, brother of <CHARNAME>, used in the battle they fought in faraway Baldur's Gate.  <CHARNAME> prevailed, destroying Sarevok's plans and rescuing the Sword Coast from the brink of war.  Now Sarevok has joined with <CHARNAME>'s cause and his blade has been restored to him.  Sarevok describes the weapon as a Deathbringer blade and has restored some of the weapon's old power.  Without his Bhaalspawn essence to channel through the sword, however, it cannot achieve the power it once had.  Still, however, it is a formidable weapon...and one that Sarevok warns would become increasingly difficult to wield in the hands of one who was not a Deathbringer, if they could use it at all.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Magic Resistance: +10%

Combat abilities:
– Each hit drains 1 to 5 Hit Points from the target and transfers it to the wielder. This will not heal beyond the wielder's maximum.
